# Dinner-Suggestions
A web app for dinner suggestions using Docker/Python/HTML/Flask.
This service randomly suggests a dinner idea from a list of my favourites.

This is helpful because I am terrible at thinking of what to cook for dinner!
I also wanted to experiment with Flask and Docker to learn about web apps/services.

I implemented this service as part of a future plan to turn an old machine into a server to run web services off.

This service will be extended in the future:
- Adding css to spruce up the front end.
- Extend the flask_restful api to actually provide api functionality...
- Be permanently running once my server is up
